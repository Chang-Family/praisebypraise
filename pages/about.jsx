        Praise by Praise was registered on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 2015.
        It is so meaningful to establish this site for Jesus with thankful heart
        on Thanksgiving Day. I give my thankful heart to Jesus that from now on,
        on every Thanksgiving Day, I have this very special thing to thank Him-
        Praise by Praise. This site is dedicated to Jesus and to the body of
        Christ.

        I have nothing, only a pure heart to love Jesus. A pure heart is enough
        to express Praise by Praise with the guidance from Holy Spirit. I have
        no music degree, only learned to play piano a few years when I was
        little. Day by day, I am filled with music, and God's love. I sing
        praise to Him everyday.

        我一無所有, 只有一顆清心愛主. 在聖靈的帶領下,
        只要有一顆清心就足夠表達永續讚美. 我沒有音樂學歷,
        只是小時候學過幾年鋼琴. 天天, 我充盈在奇妙的音律, 和神的愛中.
        我每天唱讚美神的歌.

        This is the corner of my private room where I compose songs and sing
        praise and worship God.

      <p>這是我私人空間的一角, 我在此作曲, 唱歌讚美, 敬拜神.</p>
