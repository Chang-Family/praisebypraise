Prayers after prayers and after prayers, finally, after today's morning prayer, I clicked on the payment button, and the registration of Praise by Praise went through and become official. This is the first time I ever built a website. Jesus is the only reason. I am so joyful because this is the first time for Him, and is my very special one dedicated for Him. Jesus is worthy to all our praises.

To start this site, I have to have a name. I prayed about the name for this website. I asked Lord what will be a good name for this website. After a long prayer, a song just started to sing out of my mouth so smoothly, and it goes . . .

Praise by Praise,
never ends,
everlasting praise to You.
Day by day,
we sing our praise,
we love you more and more.
. . .

I walked to the keyboard, and started to play the tone, and sang along. I started to write down the song. It was on November 9, 2015, during morning prayer, that this song came to me, and the name of the website appeared to be the first three words of the song- Praise by Praise.

The song Praise by Praise was completely during that very morning before I woke up kids and prepared them to school. I had the name for this website and even a new song was given to me, but I was so hesitated to build this website because I have never done this before. I cried and cried on many occasions, and told Lord that I need His power to take me through this. I had no support. I only trust the guidance from Holy Spirit. I was comforted many times from Holy Spirit, and have the assurance to me about building this website to publish all the songs that freely given to me from Holy Spirit guidance. Regardless many opposed forces, I would never be able to deny the gift that has given to me from the Lord. I am not able to burry it, and I shall not burry it. It will be more painful if I burry it because I love Jesus.

I freely received and I freely give.

​ 十一月二十六日, 2015 年
禱告再禱告再禱告, 終於今天晨禱後, 我按下付款格子, 登記正式成立永續讚美. 這是我第一次建立網站. 耶穌是唯一的理由. 我非常的喜悅因為第一次是為了主, 將最特別的獻給主. 耶穌配得我們所有的讚美.

網站的開始需要一個名字. 我為網站的名字禱告. 我問主, 什麼是適合網站的名字. 恒長的禱告後, 我的口開始很流暢的唱起這首歌, 我唱著. . .

讚美接讚美
不停歇
永續讚美獻給祢
一天接一天
我們頌讚
我們愛祢更多
. . .

我走到琴鍵前, 彈出音律, 也跟著音律唱起來. 我開始寫下這首歌. 那是在十一月九日, 2015 年, 的晨間禱告中, 這歌流向我, 而網站的名字就是這首歌英文版的前面三個字- 讚美接讚美 Praise by Praise, 中文我以永續讚美定名.

永續讚美這首歌的曲調在去喚醒孩子們準備上學前完成了. 網站的名字也有了, 而且連這首新歌主也給了我. 但是我仍然猶豫不決沒有馬上建立網站, 因為這一切我都不曾做過.

很多次我哭泣又哭泣, 我告訴主我需要主祢的大能帶領我克服. 我沒支持. 我只相信聖靈的帶領. 聖靈一次又一次的安慰我, 也給我確信去建立這個網站發表所有來自聖靈帶領下白白給了我的新歌. 不管許多反對的力量, 因為我無法否認主所給予我的恩賜. 我不能埋藏, 也不可以埋藏恩賜. 那將是對我更為痛苦若我將恩賜埋藏, 因為我愛耶穌.

我白白領受了, 也白白的給.
