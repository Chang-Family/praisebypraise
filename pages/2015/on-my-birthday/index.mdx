這一天, September 17, 2015, 我寫下了,
哈利路亞！讚美主！
感謝天上的父神賜予生命氣息，每一個呼吸都是我對祂的讚美，我的活出，就是為了讚美神。
(English translation below)
從昨天晚上就開始收到生日快樂，清晨又陸續收到，在主大能大力拖住地球運轉著，我們天天奇妙的經歷在祂造的時間的流動裏，台灣來的祝福先到，地球轉動著，接著來自美國的祝福也到了。我們以為理所當然，活在這地上，所當之正常運作的地，其實就是奇妙神的作為，因此保羅在羅馬書中道出了：神的事情，人所能知道的，原顯明在人心裏，因為 神已經給他們顯明。自從造天地以來， 神的永能和神性是明明可知的，雖是眼不能見，但藉著所造之物，就可以曉得，叫人無可推諉。1 章 19、20 節
生日快樂！這 4 個字的祝福，對於我來說，自從我在耶穌基督裏重生後的每一天，在基督裡都是讚美主，喜樂的日子。而生日的這一天對於我的意義就是告訴媽媽，我一定記得這一天因為您為我受生產的痛。這一天對我不再特別，因為我真正的生命重生是在認罪、悔改，接受耶穌基督後，生命才開始！
前幾天，我與主有一段對話。我問主，在我親戚，朋友們中，就已經有好一些不同的宗教，我要怎麼向他們傳福音呢？主問我，你靠吸什麼氣維生？我回氧氣。主又問我，有其他代替嗎？我回沒有，現在只有空氣中的氧氣，其他不行。祂回應我如果連我們人這樣基本活著需要吸氧氣，人必須理解，也必須接受，也必須就是吸氧氣，那麼真神可以照人的方式，任人愛好，自以為是誰，就求拜誰嗎？人沒有信靠真神不會如同幾分鐘不能呼吸就死，因為那是神的愛和憐憫。福音的大能是要救一切相信的人，神給予人相信的機會。感謝主，祂沒有按我們的罪過待我們，也沒有照我們的罪孽報應我們。主啊！祢的慈愛向敬畏祢的人是何等的大啊！
我願意將重生了我，改變了我的耶穌，真心誠意告訴尚未認識祂的您，在我生日的這一天，最不平凡的事就是將神的愛分享給予您。謝謝您們每一個記得我生日的人，願神的愛在耶穌基督裏，臨到您和您們全家，恩典滿滿。

Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!
Thanks to our Heavenly Father giving us life. Every breath of mine is my praise to Him. I live to praise Him.
Ever since last night, I started to receive happy birthday, some came in early this morning, and still more keep on coming in. From His mighty power keeping the earth rotating, everyday, miraculously, we are experiencing His creation of time. The blessing from Taiwan came in first, while earth rotating, and later followed the blessing from the United States. We often take things for granted for things that we treat as they are supposed to be. Living on earth, thinking it must turn, and in fact it is God's mighty power, and therefore apostle Paul wrote in book of Romans1:19-20 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature- have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.
Happy Birthday! To me, since I was born again in Christ Jesus, everyday is praising God and joyful day. Birthday to me become a day that I would remember to tell my mom I remember your labor pain. Birthday to me is no longer special because I truly live after I was born again, which was after I confess, repent, and accept Jesus Christ.
A couple days ago, I started a conversation with the Lord. I asked the Lord that among my friends and relatives, there are several different religions, and how may I preach gospel of the kingdom of God to them. The Lord asked me what type of air do you depend on to breathe? I replied oxygen. He asked again, is there a replacement? I replied, no, for now just oxygen in the air, no replacement. He responded to me if the basic survival need is to breathe oxygen, and it is something man must understand, must accept, and must breathe oxygen, the true living God, is it possible for man to presume whoever they love to worship however and whenever they wanted? Man did not worship and depend on the true God won't die right away like without oxygen we die in a few minutes. This is all God's love and mercy for us. The power of the gospel is to save all who believe. God gives man the opportunity to believe Him. Thanks to the Lord that He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. O Lord! How great is Your love for those who fear You!
I am willing to introduce Jesus who changed me and gave me the new life, to you not yet knowing Him, with sincerity and truthfulness. On my birthday, the most extraordinary thing is to share the love of God with you. Thank to all of you who remembered my birthday. May God's love in Jesus Christ abide in you and your family, with abundance of Grace.
